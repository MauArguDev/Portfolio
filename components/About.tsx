                I'm Mauricio, although you also know me as Mauro. I am a programmer focused on native mobile applications, 
                both Android and iOS, although honestly I like iOS more üçé. I've been working with Kotlin for Android for 
                4 years and 2 years working with Swift for iOS, I also have knowledge in other areas like React, Java for 
                backend with SpringBoot, C# and a bit of Python üêç. I love working in a team and learning from the best, 
                as well as helping those who are learning what I already know. My biggest goal as a programmer is to be 
                able to make world-class applications, things that change the world and radically innovate. Hope to see 
                you soon üòâ.
